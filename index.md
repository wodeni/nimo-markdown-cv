## Experience

### **Microsoft, Software Engineer at MSAI** `2017.6 - Present`

_Focused Inbox_<br>

**Designed** and **built** an inferencing system for Focused Inbox, an AI feature in Outlook which has more than 2.3 millions of daily active users. The system empowers the scientist team to transfer their rule-based algorithm into the machine learning models (e.g. the Gradient Boosting Machine and Distilled BERT DNN)

**Designed** and **built** a new feature store with different teams to help take the offline computed features to the product environment, including the end-to-end data validation and monitoring. The system improves the agility and flexibility of onboarding new features.

**Designed** and **built** a comprehensive monitoring and alerting system for feature extraction, feature set packaging and model evaluation, which improves the robustness and maintainability of the whole system.
Integrated the Focused Inbox system with the internal flighting platform to transfer the log-based experiment analysis into the real-time AB experimenting system, which provides a solid evaluation of model performance.

**Integrated** the Focused Inbox system with the internal static file-based model deployment platform. Transfer the model deployment from code deployment to data deployment, which largely speed up the life cycle of model development and experiment.

_Knowledge Mining_<br>

**Built** and **maintained** the Dynamic Workflow Engine as a key member. The system hosts hundreds of NLP scenarios (e.g. Key Phrase Entity) which empower the critical features of Cortex as well as Outlook search.

**Designed** and **built** the Workflow Resource Manager as a key member. This new feature detects the top consumer of CPU/Memory and halts the costly/abnormal workflow when system hits the capacity limit. 

### **CERNER, Software Engineer** `2016.10 - 2016.12`

**Built** an internal service to manage the software libraries, including the certificate and versioning. Implement the features in both back-end and front-end.
**Onboarded** the inversion of control framework (Spring) to project to make the code more testable.

### **Ericsson, ConsumerLab Intern** `2012.7 - 2012.11`

**Developed** Logistic Regression classifiers for customer category analysis, which improved about 17.3% precision on test data compared with previous BCG matrix method.

**Designed** customer value index (CVI metric) by using Principle Component Analysis
